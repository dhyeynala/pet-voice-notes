Sure! Here's a short explanation of each part of the codebase and what your final app will do:

---

### ✅ **What the End Product Does**

Your web app allows users to:

1. **Log in with Google** via Firebase Auth.
2. **See and select pets** linked to pages they are authorized for.
3. **Record voice notes** using the browser and automatically:

   * Transcribe the audio using Google Cloud Speech-to-Text.
   * Summarize the transcription using OpenAI GPT-4o.
   * Save transcript + summary in Firestore under `pets/{petId}/voice-notes/`.
4. **Upload pet medical PDFs**, which:

   * Get summarized using OpenAI.
   * Get stored in Firebase Storage and Firestore under `pets/{petId}/records/`.
5. **Collaborate via Pages**:

   * Each `page` has a list of `authorizedUsers` and linked `petIds`.
   * You can invite other users to collaborate by adding them to a `page`.

### 🧩 File-by-File Summary

#### **Frontend**

* `public/firebase-config.js`: Sets up Firebase app in the browser.
* `public/index.html`: Google login page using Firebase Auth.
* `public/record.html`: Main app interface:

  * Shows pet dropdown.
  * Buttons for: add pet, record voice, upload PDF, logout.
  * Uses Fetch API to talk to backend.

#### **Backend**

* `api_server.py`: FastAPI server that:

  * Handles voice transcription & summary (`/api/start`)
  * Uploads + summarizes PDFs (`/api/upload_pdf`)
  * Lists user's pets (`/api/user-pets/{uid}`)
  * Adds pets to users and pages
  * Handles inviting users to a page

* `auth.py`: Contains helper to create a new user doc in Firestore.

* `firestore_store.py`: Core Firestore logic:

  * Add/retrieve pets
  * Store voice notes and PDF summaries
  * Add pet to page & user
  * Handle invites to pages

* `main.py`: Runs transcription + summary pipeline using:

  * Google Speech-to-Text
  * OpenAI summarization
  * Stores result in Firestore

* `pdf_parser.py`: Extracts text from PDF using `PyMuPDF`, summarizes using OpenAI, and stores result.

* `summarize_openai.py`: Uses GPT-4o to summarize a text string robustly (with retries).

* `transcribe.py`: Captures microphone audio for a few seconds and transcribes it using Google Speech-to-Text.

* `requirements.txt`: Python packages needed to run the backend.

### 🔁 Firestore Structure After Refactor

* `users/{userId}`
  → stores: `email`, list of `pages`, list of `pets`

* `pages/{pageId}`
  → stores: `authorizedUsers`, list of `pets`, markdown (optional)

* `pets/{petId}`
  → stores:
      `voice-notes/{noteId}`: transcript, summary, timestamp
      `records/{recordId}`: summary, file name, file URL, timestamp

Let me know if you want me to walk through a flow (e.g. "what happens when user records a voice note") or help you add markdown editing for `pages/`.
